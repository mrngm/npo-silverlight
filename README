Hello everybody,

Tired of Silverlight and a so-called *public* broadcasting organistaion? Here
are some clues with regards to getting a streaming URL of an episode from the
NPO "Uitzending gemist". You can then download the video and watch when you see
fit (no pun intended).

Keep up the good work, NPO.
